# Sudoku
I present a sudoku solver written in rust, adapted from the Python code from [Lethargy](https://github.com/Lethargy/Sudoku).

# Description
This solver implements a recursive algorithm to exhaustively test all possibilities in the sudoku grid and prints the solution to a standard 9x9 sudoku puzzle.
